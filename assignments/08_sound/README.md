# Found Treasure

Welcome to the "Found Treasure" game, a computational media project for the course CSC496. This game challenges players to navigate and interact with a dynamic environment influenced by various system connections and multimedia elements.

## Five Interconnected Aspects

1. **Player Movement and Wind Force**: The player's movement is affected by wind forces that change direction and intensity over time, simulating real-world wind dynamics.
2. **Collision Detection**: Integrates with player movement to ensure that interactions with obstacles and boundaries are realistic and prevent the player from moving through objects.
3. **Gravity Effects**: Tied closely to the player's jump functionality and collision detection, gravity impacts how the player returns to the ground after jumping.
4. **Multimedia Interactions (Sound)**: Sounds are triggered by specific actions like jumping and winning, which adds an auditory layer to the visual and physical experience of the game.
5. **Dynamic Obstacle Interaction**: Users design their own obstacles directly from the camera. The uncertainty of the low-resolution camera makes obstacles sometimes obstacles and sometimes paths to treasure.

The most interesting effect is produced by the **Player Movement and Wind Force** connection. This aspect introduces a dynamic element that continuously challenges the player to adapt to changing conditions, enhancing the game's engagement and complexity.

## Multimedia Used

- **Visuals**: Animated sprites for the player and obstacles, and dynamic backgrounds.
- **Sound**: Audio clips that enhance gameplay with environmental sounds and feedback on player actions.
- **Interactive Controls**: Keyboard inputs that allow players to control the character.
